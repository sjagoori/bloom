# Bloom

Bloom is an application built by students from the minor _[Web Development (dutch)](https://everythingweb.org/)_ that is given by the University of Amsterdam. 

Together with an alumni from the study Communication and Multimedia Design we are realizing her graduation project with the skills we have learned within this minor.

Bloom is an application for patients who's cancer is in remission. They can find guidance and support from people who are or went through a similar process.

## Features

Based on the scope and time of this project the following features will be implemented in this version of the application.

- Finding information with themes
    - As an user, I want information about relevant themes about cancer and remission, so that I would know how to act and expect accordingly in this stage of the process.
- Contact with other people on this application.
    - As an user, I want to have personal contact with people in similar situations, so that I can discuss and reflect on my experiences, and further develop my coping strategies.

## FAQ

#### What is remission?

Remission means that the signs and symptoms of your cancer are reduced. Remission can be partial or complete. In a complete remission, all signs and symptoms of cancer have disappeared.  
If you remain in complete remission for 5 years or more, some doctors may say that you are cured.

Remission is the period between recovery and staying in the hospital for treatment.

#### What will this application not do?

This project is strictly for the mobile environment such as smartphones and tablets, this was a careful consideration from the product owner throughout her graduation project.
The reasoning behind this is because people in remission tend to be a mobile user and prefer chatting through a phone or tablet rather than a desktop or laptop.

For this reason this particular application will not be fully usable in a desktop environment.
